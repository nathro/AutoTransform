"""CachedFile is a utility class used by AutoTransform to cache file content on read/write to
reduce excessive file reads and speed up processing. The FILE_CACHE variable stores cached
file contents, while a CachedFile object is used to interact with the cache. All writes
should go through the CachedFile object to ensure the cache is properly updated."""
